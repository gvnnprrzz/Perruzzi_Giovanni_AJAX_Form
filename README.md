# HW #3 - AUTHORING / WEB EMAIL VALIDATION

In this project, I will extend functionality to include PHP validation for each input element passed through the `$POST` array. Upon successful validation, the server will send an email, and provide feedback messages to the user interface for pass and fail cases.

## Installation and Running

To run the web app, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local directory using the command:

    git clone <Perruzzi_Giovanni_AJAX_Form>

Navigate to the project directory using the cd command:

    cd Perruzzi_Giovanni_AJAX_Form

Alternatively, you can download the app by visiting the repository, clicking the green "Code" button, and selecting "Download ZIP."

## Usage

1. Open the web app in your preferred web browser.

2. Interact with the application, entering the necessary input data.

3. The application will perform PHP validation on the input data.

4. If validation is successful, the server will send an email.

5. You will receive feedback messages on the user interface to inform you of the pass or fail status.
